# Client Database Analysis
This challenge consisted of using starter [code](https://github.com/mikeyms1/pandas-challenge-1/blob/main/wholesale_data_analysis_starter_code.ipynb) and then doing a data analysis on a client [dataset](https://github.com/mikeyms1/pandas-challenge-1/blob/main/Resources/client_dataset.csv) to determine sunch things as identifying top customers, finding popular product categories, and calculating profits.

Python's Pandas library was used to do the analysis in jupyter notebook.  The final analysis can be found in the [wholesale_data_analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/mikeyms1/pandas-challenge-1/blob/main/wholesale_data_analysis.ipynb) file.

A summary of the findings in the data can be found at the bottom of the final anlysis.
